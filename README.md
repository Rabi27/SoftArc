# SoftArc
SoftArc is a reverse engineering tool I built as a Final Year Project that simplifies the visualisation of Java, C++, and C# source code files by generating a class diagram. With SoftArc, you can effortlessly extract variables, methods, and relationships from complex code files, enabling you to understand the code structure and dependencies quickly.

The tool features authentication implemented using JWT tokens, ensuring privacy and security. Additionally, users can download the generated class diagram as a PDF or save it directly to the database for future reference. SoftArc also allows users to share the generated class diagrams with others via email, enhancing collaboration and teamwork.

# Technologies Used
React for the front end. Django for the backend. SQLite for the database.
